# Predicting Forest Fire Risk Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) system for predicting the risk and causes of forest fires. Leveraging a wide array of data, including meteorological, topographical, vegetation, and historical fire data, as well as human activity, we've designed a system that can estimate the probability of fire occurrence, identify potential fire causes, and provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

### Deliverables

- **Data Processing and Analysis System**: Implementation of data processing techniques including data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, and other preprocessing steps.
- **Predictive Models**: Development of classification and regression models to predict the likelihood, size, and severity of fire occurrences.
- **Maintenance Plans**: Continuous updates and optimizations of models with new data and environmental changes.

## Data Source and Description

The dataset includes U.S. Wildfire Records and incorporates a variety of features significant to forest fire risk assessment. A detailed description of the data sources and their respective features is available in the [Data](/forestfires.csv) directory.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

We have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, trends, and potential correlations. The [Notebooks](/forest-fire.ipynb) directory contains Jupyter notebooks illustrating this analysis, including visualizations of key variables.


## Expected Business Value

- Minimization of property damage and conservation of natural habitats.
- Enhancement of public safety with reduced emergency response times.
- Strengthening of community evacuation strategies and proactive environmental management.

## Weekly Progress

Completed the collection and integration of U.S. Wildfire Records into the predictive model.
- **Preliminary data analysis Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct preliminary analysis of collected data to understand data distribution, trends, and potential correlations. Identify key variables: Start identifying key variables that may have a significant impact on forest fire risk.
- **Preliminary model development Model Development: Start developing and debugging basic machine learning models. Preliminary testing: Conduct preliminary testing using a small set of data to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
- **Teamwork and communication Team Meetings: Hold regular team meetings todiscuss progress, challenges and next steps.
