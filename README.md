# Predicting Forest Fire Risk Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML) system for predicting the risk and causes of forest fires. Leveraging a wide array of data, including meteorological, topographical, vegetation, and historical fire data, as well as human activity, we've designed a system that can estimate the probability of fire occurrence, identify potential fire causes, and provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

### Deliverables

- **Data Processing and Analysis System**: Implementation of data processing techniques including data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, and other preprocessing steps.
- **Predictive Models**: Development of classification and regression models to predict the likelihood, size, and severity of fire occurrences.
- **Maintenance Plans**: Continuous updates and optimizations of models with new data and environmental changes.

## Data Source and Description

The dataset includes U.S. Wildfire Records and incorporates a variety of features significant to forest fire risk assessment. A detailed description of the data sources and their respective features is available in the [Data](/Data) directory.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

We have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, trends, and potential correlations. The [Notebooks](/Notebooks) directory contains Jupyter notebooks illustrating this analysis, including visualizations of key variables.

## Installation and Usage

Instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the predictive models are provided in the [Installation](/Installation) directory.

## Expected Business Value

- Minimization of property damage and conservation of natural habitats.
- Enhancement of public safety with reduced emergency response times.
- Strengthening of community evacuation strategies and proactive environmental management.

## Weekly Progress

We maintain a log of our weekly progress in the [Progress](/Progress) directory, showcasing completed tasks and ongoing efforts.
